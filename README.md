# Generalised-Data-Structure-Library
The Gen STL Project!


Technology Used : C++ Programming
Description:
• This project is considered as a Library which contains generic implementations of all major type of Data Structures.
• It provides the readymade implementations of all fundamental operations as well as advanced operations on linear, non-linear Data Structures in an object-oriented way.
• It also provides the generic way of implementation so we can use the functionality for any type of data types.
• All the object-oriented design policies are used in this project.
